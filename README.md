# ChatGPT UI Enhancements
## Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing the user interface (UI) of ChatGPT to make chat interactions more efficient and user-friendly. The primary goal is to address the issue of lengthy chat messages, which can be cumbersome to follow and require extensive scrolling.

## Key Feature: Improved Chat Navigation
### Collapsible Chat Messages
Chat messages from ChatGPT can be long and detailed, making it difficult to follow the conversation without constant scrolling. To solve this, we introduced a feature that allows users to collapse chat messages, reducing the need for excessive scrolling and making the chat more navigable.

### Side Panel for Message Preview
To further enhance the chat experience, we added a side panel that can be toggled open or closed with a button. This side panel provides a preview of chat messages, allowing users to quickly scan through the content without losing their place in the conversation.

## How to Use
- Toggle Side Panel: Click the button labeled "Toggle Preview" to open or close the side panel.
- Collapse Messages: When the side panel is open, all chat messages in the main chat window will be collapsed, showing only the first line or a brief summary. This makes it easier to navigate through the conversation.
- Preview Messages: Use the side panel to preview the full content of any message. This allows you to read lengthy responses without having to scroll through the main chat window.

## Benefits
- Reduced Scrolling: By collapsing long messages and providing a preview in the side panel, users can follow the conversation more easily without constant scrolling.
- Enhanced Readability: The side panel preview helps users quickly find and read specific messages, improving the overall readability of the chat.
- Improved Navigation: Collapsing messages in the main chat window makes it easier to navigate through long conversations, helping users to keep track of the discussion flow.
